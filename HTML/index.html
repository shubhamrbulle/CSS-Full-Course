      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing
        the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It
        allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such
        as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML
        and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of
        HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets
        across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is
        referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from
        presentation.
